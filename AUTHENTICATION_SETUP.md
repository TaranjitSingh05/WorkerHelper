# WorkerHelper Authentication System Setup Guide

## Overview
Complete authentication system with Supabase Auth integration, supporting both email/password and Worker ID/phone number authentication methods.

## Prerequisites
1. Run `workers_data_setup.sql` first to create the basic workers_data table
2. Have Supabase project configured with environment variables

## Step 1: Database Setup

### Run the Authentication Integration SQL
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `auth_integration_setup.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute

### What this script does:
- ✅ Adds `user_id` column to link workers_data with Supabase Auth users
- ✅ Creates performance indexes
- ✅ Enables Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Sets up RLS policies for authenticated users
- ✅ Creates helper functions for Worker ID/phone validation
- ✅ Creates a view for dashboard data

## Step 2: Configure Supabase Auth Settings

### Email Templates (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to **Authentication > Templates** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Customize the email templates:
   - **Confirm signup**: Welcome email with verification link

2. Dashboard shows "No Health Record Found"
3. Options to "Create Health Record" or "Link Existing Record"
4. After creating record, full dashboard displays
```

### New User (Has Health Record):

1. Sign Up with Worker ID/Phone → Email Verification → Sign In
2. Dashboard shows option to link existing record
3. After linking, full dashboard displays with all data
```

### Existing User:
```
1. Sign In → Dashboard with full worker data
2. Can update information, view QR code, access quick actions
3. Information pre-fills when updating health record
```

### Anonymous User (QR Code Scan):
```
1. QR code scanned → Worker details page
2. Shows limited public information only
3. Option to create account or sign in
```

## Step 6: Testing Scenarios

### Test Account Creation:
```bash
# Test data for signup
Email: test@example.com
Password: testpass123
Full Name: Test Worker
```

### Test Worker Record:
```bash
# Create via /personal-health-record
Full Name: Test Worker
Phone: 1234567890
Worker ID: WH-ABC123-XYZ789 (auto-generated)
```

### Test Linking:
```bash
# After signup, link account with:
Worker ID: WH-ABC123-XYZ789
Phone: 1234567890
```

## Step 7: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "Email not confirmed"
- **Problem**: User tries to sign in before confirming email
- **Solution**: Check email inbox and click verification link

#### "Invalid Worker ID or Phone Number" 
- **Problem**: Worker credentials don't match database
- **Solution**: Verify record exists and credentials are correct

#### "Table 'workers_data' does not exist"
- **Problem**: Database setup incomplete
- **Solution**: Run `workers_data_setup.sql` then `auth_integration_setup.sql`

#### "Permission denied"
- **Problem**: RLS policies not working correctly
- **Solution**: Check policy creation in SQL execution results

#### User can't see their data
- **Problem**: `user_id` not properly linked
- **Solution**: Use link account function or check database linking

### Debug Commands:

```sql
-- Check if user exists in auth.users
SELECT id, email, created_at FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- Check worker record linking
SELECT health_id, full_name, user_id FROM workers_data WHERE health_id = 'WH-ABC123-XYZ789';

-- Test validation function
SELECT * FROM validate_worker_credentials('WH-ABC123-XYZ789', '1234567890');

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'workers_data';
```

## Step 8: Production Considerations

### Security:
- ✅ RLS policies properly configured
- ✅ Email verification enforced
- ✅ Strong password requirements
- ✅ Secure session management

### Performance:
- ✅ Database indexes for user lookups
- ✅ Efficient queries for dashboard data
- ✅ Minimal auth state management

### Scalability:
- ✅ Supabase Auth handles user management
- ✅ Database constraints prevent data integrity issues
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships
