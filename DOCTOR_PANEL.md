## Access Control

### Role-Based Authentication
- Only users with `doctor` role in Clerk metadata can access the doctor panel
- Protected routes using `DoctorProtectedRoute` component
- Automatic redirection based on user role

### Setting Doctor Role
To grant doctor access to a user, update their Clerk user metadata:
```javascript
{
  "publicMetadata": {
    "role": "doctor"
  }
}
```

## Routes

### Doctor-Specific Routes
- `/doctor/dashboard` - Main doctor dashboard
- `/doctor/worker/:workerId` - Individual worker profile and reports

### Protected Routes
All doctor routes are protected by the `DoctorProtectedRoute` component which:
- Verifies user authentication
- Checks for doctor role
- Shows loading states
- Handles access denied scenarios

## Database Schema

### Medical Reports Table
```sql
medical_reports (
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  report_id: TEXT UNIQUE,
  worker_health_id: TEXT (Foreign Key),
  doctor_clerk_id: TEXT (Clerk User ID),
  report_title: TEXT,
  report_type: TEXT,
  report_description: TEXT,
  diagnosis: TEXT,
  treatment: TEXT,
  notes: TEXT,
  follow_up_required: BOOLEAN,
  follow_up_date: TIMESTAMP,
  report_date: TIMESTAMP,
  created_at: TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Doctor Dashboard Statistics View
```sql
doctor_dashboard_stats (
  doctor_clerk_id: TEXT,
  total_reports: INTEGER,
  unique_workers: INTEGER,
  reports_today: INTEGER,
  reports_this_week: INTEGER,
  pending_followups: INTEGER
)
```

## Usage Workflow

2. Click "Add New Report" button
3. Fill out comprehensive report form:
   - Report title and type
   - Detailed description
   - Diagnosis and treatment
   - Additional notes
   - Follow-up requirements
4. Submit report for immediate saving

### 4. Managing Follow-ups

2. Optional follow-up date scheduling
3. Dashboard shows pending follow-ups count
4. Follow-up indicators in report timeline

## Security Features
